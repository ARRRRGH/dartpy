# dartpy
A python package to dispatch and manage DART simulations.


This version is still very beta. I am actively developing the package as I go along using it. If you use DART on a regular 
basis and you are wondering why there doesn't exist a decent python package for it, too, consider contributing! If you have code
that you would like to include as part of a standard distribution, that's also very much appreciatied.

Up to now, the package only supports xml creation for the DART input as well as a patching framework to include valid xml output in 
new simulations easily. Support for database creation, dispatching runs as well as postprocessing will be added soon.

For the time being there won't be a proper API. Look up the tests for some examples. They should be more or less self-explanatory. If not, let me know, I may have missed the point in this case.
