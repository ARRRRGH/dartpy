# dartpy
A python package to dispatch and manage DART simulations.


This version is still very beta. I am actively developing the package as I go along using it. If you use DART on a regular 
basis and you are wondering why there doesn't exist a decent python package for it, too, consider contributing! If you have code
that you would like to include as part of a standard distribution, that's also very much appreciatied.

Up to now, the package only supports xml creation for the DART input as well as a patching framework to include valid xml output in 
new simulations easily. Support for database creation, dispatching runs as well as postprocessing will be added soon.
